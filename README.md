Pretty Mes is a tiny Flask application that creates mesostic poems (a type of visual poetry) from current news headlines. Pretty Mes is deployed on Heroku and can be found at https://prettymes.herokuapp.com.

I've also writen [a blog post](https://medium.com/@bronze_by_gold/a-flask-app-for-generative-visual-poetry-from-news-headlines-4eb469e9d7ee) describing how I created Pretty Mes and how it works.
