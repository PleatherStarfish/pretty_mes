Pretty Mes is a Flask app that parses current news headlines to generate "mesostics" (a type of procedural poem) and generative typographies from current news headlines in the style of American experimental artist John Cage. Pretty Mes is deployed on Heroku and can be found at https://prettymes.herokuapp.com.
